# Genetic Algorithm to find N numbers such that the sum of their squares equals X
 <h4>Created as part of course CS5100-Foundations of Artificial Intelligence at Northeastern University</h4>

<div>

<h3>Steps involved in Genetic Algorithm</h3>
<ol>
 <li>Initialization - generate a list of p random individuals for initial population</li>
 <li>Fitness calculation - absolute distance from the goal</li>
 <li>Selection - select few individuals from population with higher priority given to individuals with higher fitness function</li>
 <li>Crossover - crossover between two distinct parents to create offsprings</li>
 <li>Mutation - change value of a single allele in each child</li>
 <li>Repetition - repeat above process until the result is obtained</li>
</ol>

<h3>Files included</h3>

<li>genetic_n_numbers.py - Python code for the class Evolution used to implement the genetic algorithm</li>
